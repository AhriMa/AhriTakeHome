### Scoring Rules

**Strike**

**Spare**

If you knock down all 10 pins using both shots of a frame, you get a spare.
How to score: A spare earns 10 points *plus the sum of your next one shot.*

**Open Frame**

If you do not knock down all 10 pins using both shots of your frame (9 or fewer pins knocked down), you have an open frame.
How to score: An open frame only earns the number of pins knocked down.

**The 10th Frame**

The 10th frame is a bit different:
If you roll a strike in the first shot of the 10th frame, you get 2 more shots.
If you roll a spare in the first two shots of the 10th frame, you get 1 more shot.
If you leave the 10th frame open after two shots, the game is over and you do not get an additional shot.
How to Score: The score for the 10th frame is the total number of pins knocked down in the 10th frame.
